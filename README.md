# 🏠 House Price Prediction | Coding Samurai

This project is a simple **house price prediction** system built using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and **scikit-learn**. It demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), outlier detection, and a multiple linear regression model to predict housing prices based on various features.

## 📑 Project Description

The goal of this notebook is to predict house prices based on features such as area, bedrooms, bathrooms, furnishing status, and more using a **Multiple Linear Regression** model. The project involves:

- Importing and exploring the dataset.
- Handling categorical variables using **Label Encoding**.
- Detecting and removing outliers with **z-score method**.
- Visualizing data distributions with **Seaborn**.
- Building and evaluating a regression model.

## 📈 Workflow

1. **Data Loading:** Load the dataset using `pandas.read_csv`.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Remove duplicate entries.
3. **Encoding:** Convert categorical variables into numerical values with `LabelEncoder`.
4. **EDA:** Visualize distributions, outliers, and feature relationships.
5. **Outlier Detection:** Remove price outliers using z-score.
6. **Model Building:** Train a Multiple Linear Regression model.
7. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate using R² score and Mean Squared Error.
